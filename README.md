I developed two interactive dashboards in Tableau to support stakeholders, including sales managers and executives, in evaluating sales performance and understanding customer engagement.

**Sales Dashboard:**

This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of key sales metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to analyze year-over-year sales performance and identify sales patterns.
